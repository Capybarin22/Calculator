# JavaScript Calculator

## Project Goal

Create an interactive calculator using JavaScript that allows users to perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, power operations, factorials, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and memory management.

## Features

- **Basic Operations:**
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Input handling via buttons with numbers and operators.

- **Advanced Functions:**
  - Power calculations, including squaring, root extraction, and inverse powers.

- **Factorial:**
  - Calculate the factorial of positive integers.

- **Memory:**
  - Save, retrieve, and clear values from memory.
  - Memory operations: add (M+), subtract (M-), clear (MC), save (MS), recall (MR).

- **Error Handling:**
  - Display errors such as division by zero or invalid input.

- **Input Management:**
  - Clear all data or delete the last character.
  - Supports parentheses for operation precedence.

## Technical Details
