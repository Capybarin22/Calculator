JavaScript Calculator

Project Goal: Create an interactive calculator using JavaScript that allows users to perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, power operations, factorials, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and memory management.

Features:
  Basic Operations:
    Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Handles input through buttons with numbers and operators.
  Advanced Functions:
		Power calculations, including squaring, root extraction, and inverse powers.
		Supports trigonometric (sin, cos, tan) and logarithmic functions.
  Factorial:
		Implements a function to calculate the factorial of positive integers.
  Memory:
		Ability to save, retrieve, and clear values from memory.
		Memory operations: add to current value (M+), subtract (M-), clear memory (MC), save to memory (MS), recall from memory (MR).
  Error Handling:
		Handles and displays errors such as division by zero or invalid input.
  Input Management:
		Clear all data or delete the last character.
		Supports parentheses for operation precedence.

Technical Details:
  HTML and CSS: Used to create and style the calculator interface.
	JavaScript: Implements the calculator logic, including handling button click events and performing calculations.
	DOM Manipulation: Used to access input elements and output results.
	eval Function: Utilized to evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user.
